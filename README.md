Gaussian Elimination using MPI

This implementation provides a good parallel algorithm for Gaussian Elimination. Scaling behavior is reasonable and the code also provides a framework for partial pivoting. 

2D-mapping support and improved exception handling is necessary to address known issues with robustness and scalability.

See enclosed report for details.

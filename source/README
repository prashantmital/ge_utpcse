---------------------------------------------------------------
The final code resides in 'final' and 'final_pivoting' directories.
Other version of the code have been included in the repository
for future use. However, I would not be surprised if some of
these version are broken. 

To run the code please follow these instructions:

make clean
make 
ibrun -np <np> main.out nrows <nr> ncols <nc> nproc <np> nreps <nr>

Please refer to the write up for a brief description of what
each parameter does. All parameters to main.out MUST be supplied.
Running the program without the correct parameters specified
will print a brief usage message.
